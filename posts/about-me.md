Graduated from De La Salle University. 
 
- I like coding
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
 
Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
